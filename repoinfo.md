# Contributing

Development of the distro is done on [GitHub](https://github.com/instantOS)

## Todo

[here](https://github.com/instantOS/instantOS/projects/1) is a list of all things
that still need to be done. Help with any of these is highly appreciated.
If you plan on introducing a new feature, be sure to discuss it with the
developers first to make sure it is actually wanted and does not already exist.

if you still really want/have to.
