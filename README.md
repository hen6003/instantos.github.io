instantOS is an Arch based distro that works out of the box but is still aimed at power users.
Everything is lightning fast, flexible and just works.

## Features

### Just works
The user does not have to worry about everything from wifi to volume and brightness, theming and notification-management. 
The distro is also tested with non-techies as well as power users. 

### Power-user friendly
Loads of keybindings and extra features ensure a high skill ceiling that is still simple to get started with. 

### Flexible
instantOS can be used with only a keyboard, mouse or even touchscreen (which makes it the only tiling capable distro with full tablet support)
It has support for tiling and floating windows and allows working with both of them. 

### Ultra lightweight
The RAM usage on idle is about 150-160Mb. That is less than half of what the lightest Ubuntu flavor uses. 
It comes with as little bloat as possible without sacrificing on features.
