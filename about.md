# About

**instantOS** is based on [Archlinux](https://archlinux.org/) and maintains full
compatibility with the Arch-Wiki and AUR.
It uses a custom window manager with a bunch of facilitating custom software
to provide an experience similar to a desktop environment but as **powerful and
fast as a window manager**. In fact, all pieces being made for each other
allows things that wouldn't be possible by just editing dotfiles.
It also has its own installer **[instantARCH](https://github.com/instantOS/instantARCH)**
and **[instantNIX](https://github.com/instantOS/instantNIX/)** provides packages for
the [Nix](https://nixos.org/explore.html) universal package manager and [NixOS](https://nixos.org).

## suckless

**instantOS** is not a [suckless](https://suckless.org) distro. instantWM, instantLOCK and instantMENU
started out as suckless forks, but contain less than 40% original suckless
code and go into different directions.
For instance, programs that are under 40kb should not put storage at such a
high priority. Stability, usability, features and speed are more important.
In contrast to [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org), **instantOS** provides a complete, consistently good user 
experience out of the box that is easy to configure and customize.
It comes with a sensible feature set without sacrificing a certain minimalism.
