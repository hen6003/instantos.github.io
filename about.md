# About

instantOS is based on [Arch](https://archlinux.org/) and maintains full
compatibility with the Arch-Wiki and AUR.
It uses a custom window manager with a bunch of facilitating custom software
to provide an experience similar to a desktop environment but as **powerful and
fast as a window manager**. In fact, all pieces being made for each other
allows things that wouldn't be possible by just editing dotfiles.
It also has its own installer instantARCH

## suckless

instantOS is not a suckless distro. instantWM, intantLOCK and instantMENU
started out as suckless forks, but contain less than 40% original suckless
code and go into different directions.
For instance, programs that are under 40kb should not put storage at such a
high priority. Stability, features and speed are more important.
