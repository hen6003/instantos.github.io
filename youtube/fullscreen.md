# Fakefullscreen

Fakefullscreen allows you to resize and move fullscreen windows. The
application will still think it is in full screen.
This can be used to move applications that would otherwise be stuck on the
monitor they launched on or to correct applications that behave incorrectly.

To toggle fakefullscreen, press Super + Shift + F
If the application is not in fullscreen, this will not have any noticeable effect.
But as soon as the application goes into fullscreen, it will not cover the
entire screen, but can still be put into layouts, moved around in floating
mode or even resized. Some applications will not like being resized while in
full screen mode, so be careful with that. Fakefullscreen can also be
activated for applications that are already in fullscreen mode.
Pressing Super + Shift + F a second time will deactivate fakefullscreen.
